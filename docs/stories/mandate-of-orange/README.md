## Chapter 1: The Unexpected Journey

On a stormy January night in 2025, Donald Trump was pacing in his Mar-a-Lago estate. Suddenly, a strange bolt of lightning struck the golden lightning rod of the mansion, and the world twisted before his eyes. When he opened them again, he found himself in a magnificent palace adorned with gold.

"Your Majesty! The Emperor has awakened!" Several eunuchs hastily kowtowed.

Trump looked around to find himself lying on an ornate dragon bed, wearing imperial robes of bright yellow. In a nearby bronze mirror, he saw that while his face remained unchanged, his hair had been styled in the fashion of a Qing Dynasty official.

"What's going on? Where am I?" Trump instinctively asked.

"What strange words does Your Majesty speak?" the Chief Eunuch trembled as he asked, "Is the Dragon Body unwell?"

Trump quickly realized he had traveled through time to ancient China, and had become the Emperor directly. This dramatic turn of events left him both confused and excited.

## Chapter 2: The New Reforms

After the initial shock, Trump began governing the country in his unique style. His first decision was to build a "magnificent wall" to defend against the northern nomadic tribes.

"This will be the greatest Great Wall, better than all previous walls!" Trump announced to his court officials. "And I'll make the Tartars pay for it!"

The court officials exchanged bewildered glances, unsure how to respond to their suddenly transformed emperor. However, some of Trump's decisions proved surprisingly effective:

- He vigorously developed commerce, lowered merchant taxes, and supported private trade
- Introduced a Twitter-like "Imperial Forum" allowing citizens to directly petition the emperor
- Promoted his branded buildings nationwide, establishing the "Trump Mansions" luxury residence series

## Chapter 3: Court Intrigue

However, Trump's unconventional ruling style provoked strong opposition from conservative ministers. They believed the emperor's actions violated ancestral institutions and plotted against him in secret.

Trump responded in his characteristic way: "Fake News! These people are all fake news!" he declared loudly in court, "They're the puppets of the failing establishment!"

To the ministers' surprise, Trump's straightforward way of speaking actually gained considerable support among the common people. The citizens found that although this new emperor acted strangely, he was at least direct and got things done.

## Chapter 4: Diplomatic Storms

In handling relations with neighboring countries, Trump's negotiation skills proved unexpectedly effective. He frequently invited foreign envoys to dine in his newly built Golden Hall, showcasing the palace's luxury while negotiating treaties.

"Look, you need to understand," he would tell visiting diplomats, "doing business with the Great Qing is the best choice, we have the best tea, the best silk. It's a great deal, very great!"

## Final Chapter: The Orange Dynasty

Under Trump's rule, this parallel-world Qing Dynasty displayed a unique kind of prosperity. He combined his business acumen with imperial power to create a dynasty that was both ancient and modern.

All palaces were painted gold, and official robes had to be embroidered with the "TRUMP" insignia. This period was later referred to by court historians as the "Orange Dynasty."

Yet Trump never forgot he came from another world. Late at night, he would climb alone to his custom-built star-gazing tower, gazing at the horizon, perhaps pondering his bizarre experience or planning his next surprising reform.

Some court historians secretly recorded: though this unusual emperor broke countless traditions, he unexpectedly brought new vitality to the Great Qing. In his own way, he wrote a unique legend of "The Emperor with the Mandate of Orange."
